# Genetic-Programming-for-feature-selection-and-classification
Feature selection and construction are effective techniques in reducing the dimensionality while improving classification performance. This work develops a novel genetic programming (GP) based two-stage approach to feature selection and feature construction for network intrusion dataset based on classification.
